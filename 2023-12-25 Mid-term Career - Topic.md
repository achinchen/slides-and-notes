## Before Diving
- Why do we need to think about the career?
	- Pining the goal and guiding the direction when we are losing.
	- Sometimes, we need to use these to confirm the jobs are good for company and ourselves.
		- If those are not, then you will find better work or seek other opportunities.
	- And then...?
		- You can optimize the resource arrangement no matter the time or energy.
			- Generally, you would be happier when you know what you want to do next day.
				- You can control and distribute the resources for it.

## Let's get starting
- Start from 3 questions
	- Where do you want to go?
	- When do you plan to go?
	- What's the gap between reality and expectation?
- For example,
	- Being a senior is a milestone to provide a bigger impact on the community/company/group of people surrounding me.
		- so we know being a senior is the milestone instead of the goal.
			- Is there any other possibility to contribute to the goal `bigger impact` here?
				- Scientist? => It expects me to get back to school study and do the researches.
				- Sociologist => nope, I want to be more technician a bit notÂ just directly jump into the question.
				- ...
		- How long do I plan to achieve it?
			- I believe it's hard to get the space after 40. -> Actually it's not the real.
				- If I want to be CTO, then I have 2 plans (eventually, we can say it's the one.)
					- I found the company, and as technical founder absolutely would be the CTO.
					- I entered the company and climbed the engineering ladder (then job hop to get the CTO position or found the company ðŸ˜Š)
				- 16 = 40 - 24, I have 16 years and I divide it by 4(sr. -> staff -> principal -> CTO). -> 4 years.
		- What's the gap between reality and expectation
			- expectation
